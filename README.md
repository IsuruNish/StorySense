# SCS4224 Final Year Project in Computer Science

### Project title : Estimating Story Points in Scrum By Maintaining Both Accuracy and Interpretability

This repository provides the code used for training, evaluating and XAI methods for my reserach project.

Key Components:

- **Datasets**: The datasets folder contains the 3 datasets used in this study. These datasets are available to anyone in order to facilitate further research in story point estimation.

- **Code**: The classes folder houses all the code segments used for various aspects of this research:
  _ Data preprocessing steps to prepare the text data for model training.
  _ Training scripts for different machine learning models for story point prediction. \* Code for XAI methods that provide insights into model predictions.
  Getting Started:
